        - secure boot & verify device integrity
        - hardware-backed keystore on phone
        - no implementation details

## Fake image detection

- [Can people identify original and manipulated photos of
    real-world scenes?](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5514174/),
    Springer Cognitive Research, 2017
    - people can hardly tell if and how image manipulated
- [Explaining Why Fake Photos are Fake:
    Does It Work?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3567558), ACM HCI, 2022
    - people cannot tell if image manipulated
    - explaining manipulation does not always help
