# Cloud Computing

operational expense (OPEX), capital expense (CAPEX) → centralize server

tenant isolation: challenge for cloud provider

cloud provider classification: infrastructure/ platform/ software as a service

data center hierarchy: rack, row & aisle, pod (building unit)

top-of-rack (ToR) switch: 2 per rack, high capacity

- north-south traffic: outside to inside—load balancing
- east-west traffic: within inside—high bandwidth

network topology

- fat tree. problem: require insane link capacity on top
    - link aggregation: bond multiple link together
- leaf-spine topology (clos): layered multiple spine connected to multiple rack

Internet redundancy: multiple ISP

data storage

- classical approach: server with own HDD, data replication
- modern approach: separate compute/ storage unit, SSD, less data replication

Hadoop

- automatic MapReduce management
- HDFS: Hadoop distributed file system
    - assume each server has own storage
    - append-only, 128MB block
    - NameNode index, DataNode store
    - try to compute with local data

Spark

- multi-paradigm, high-performance
- building block: resilient distributed dataset (RDD)
    - general, lazy, ephemeral, lineage, shareable
    - aggressive caching with LRU

paravirtualization: modify guest OS to not use kernel space

- high performance
- hard to modify OS

full virtualization

- native performance
- need hardware support (e.g. ring -1 for hypervisor)

container

- isolate: network namespace, file system, process information, user
- Linux containers (LXC): more full system than Docker

automation level: deployment & configuration, → monitoring & measurement,
→ trends & prediction, → root cause analysis, → troubleshooting

- vendor-independent configuration:
    zero-touch provisioning & infrastructure as code

orchestration

- building blocks: ephemeral, can be replicated, replaced, composed
    → update, autoscaling, restore
- load balancing
- early error detection during rollout

Kubernetes

- pod: group of container, smallest unit to be managed
    - init container: run before other

microservice: smaller scope & team, modularity, less complexity,
    language flexibility, test coverage, rapid deployment, fault isolation;
    cascading error, functionality & data duplication, attack surface

service mesh proxy: load balancing, convert conventional communication protocol

hysteresis: delay in response to change

- cause instability, oscillation
- event-based controller
- stabilization window

serverless/ FaaS: API redirection & runtime & DB by provider.
    event-driven, stateless, scale from zero to infinite

classic software development → agile → DevOps →
    site reliability engineering (SRE):
    merge development, quality assurance, operation

- version management
- extensive testing in continuous integration
- sandbox & canary deployment
- SRE: half time development, max half time operation,
    overflow redirect to development team
    - on-call shift
        - post-mortem report, pager fatigue
    - error budget: target < 100% availability, adjust development accordingly
    - playbook: automate away human

networking safety and isolation: harden north-south traffic,
    assume cooperation & prevent traffic among tenant on east-west traffic

- same tenant: overlay topology (virtual) & underlay (physical)
- different tenant: traffic like north-south
- implementation: VLAN, packet carry tag
    - VXLAN (extended): encapsulate, solve 4096 VLAN limit

remote storage interface: file/ block interface (NFS/ virtual disk)

object storage: key-bytes pair
