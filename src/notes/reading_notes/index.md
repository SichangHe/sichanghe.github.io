    - anticipation trump focus
    - habit to rely on tool kill memory
    - trying to split attention make though shallow

    - post-GPT are decoder-only
    - logistic regression is often superb for domain-specific task
    - RLHF degrade performance
    - parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT):
        use adapter alongside frozen model
    - quantization massively reduce RAM usage
    - Falcon-7B LLM: used in demo, said to have cleaned training data,
        open-source
    - fine tuning demo done on V100 in Colab

    - neuroplasticity apply during fast eye movement sleep
    - focus & alertness is how remember; sleep is prerequisite; meditation,
        NSDR are tool
    - testing help remember; test ASAP after exposure
        - best be open-ended, short answer, minimal prompt,
            require critical thinking
        - do not matter for memory if wrong
    - perceived familiarity hinder memory
    - gap effect: pause in talk greatly reinforce memory
