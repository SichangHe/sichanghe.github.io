# Back from Duke

20230313

I have abandoned this diary for a long time since I went to Duke last fall
semester.
This could be reasoned at follows:

- I was taking five courses at Duke and was busy.
- I made suboptimal ex-relationship decisions that are time-consuming.
- I was occupied with shiny new tech, trying out Neovim, Elixir, etc.

## Duke semester

Duke seemed like a real school.
People walked around carrying books and talking to others.
In all my classes (except perhaps CS 203), class activities were unmatched
compared to DKU classes.

The courses have loads of homework, almost as much homework as DKU courses
each week.
But, the courses are not difficult as DKU courses in that you have the time and
chance to "breathe."
Unlike crappy DKU seven-week courses, Duke courses last for 14 weeks,
and give you one extra week for reviews, one extra week for final exams.

I took:

- CS 203, Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science
- CS 205, Computer Architecture
- CS 371, Intro to Machine Learning
- MATH 401, Abstract Algebra
- MATH 431, Real Analysis

I have not much motivation to talk about them in details.

In general, Duke CS classes taught me real stuff, unlike DKU CS classesâ€¦

## Ex-relationship

The relationship ended with a special COVID related drama that I could not
foresee.

What I did foresee, though, was its nature of temporariness.
Back then, I wrote the relationship contract with a clause regarding break ups.

What I think went wrong, was that I pet them too much and they behaved more and
more like a pet, dependent, purposeless, and naughty.
