# IMC '24

*Started: 2024-11-10. Finished: 2024-11-29.*

I am on an A380 flying back to Los Angeles at 0.9 mach.
IMC '24 just concluded yesterday.
It was nice in that I heard several interesting talks, met enthusiastic people,
and ate random Spanish food at the conference.
I also gave a talk, which mostly went as planned.
It was unfortunate in that I got sick midway through the trip and
struggled with jet lag despite having stayed in UTC+1 for
4 days before the conference.

Let me recall the mishaps I experienced leading to the conference and
the journey in Europe.

## Funding issues

The \$2000 trip was originally not funded at all.

After my paper was accepted, I asked three departments of DKU for travel funds,
and got none. The main argument is I have graduated.
I offered a proposition to the executive vise chancellor, offering to
list DKU as my only institution in the paper.
Apparently, they did not recognize the significance of having papers in
conferences this prestige, despite DKU not having papers in
conferences at this level.
With that, DKU officially have zero direct contribution in my paper, so
I decided not to list them as my institution.

This was at one point a huge time eater and upset moment.
It is especially upsetting because I got a personal offer to
partially fund my travel, in exchange for DKU being listed as my institution,
which would have looked very shameful.
However, this is understandable because I know DKU is experiencing a decline in
administrative efficiency.
Though, Italo also thought it looked bad, and listed DKU as
his institution alongside UFMG.

Eventually, I followed Harsha's advice to apply for a student travel grant from
IMC, and fortunately got it.
This twist, however, caused delays in my preparation for the conference, and
had time implications I would discover later.

## Visa shopping

IMC '24 was in Madrid, Spain, but I did not got a Spanish visa.
This would normally have meant I would not be able to enter Spain at all, as
is the case for several presenters.
I was at the conference thanks to a workaround for Schengen visas.

I applied for the Spanish visa through their official agency,
got rejected because of minor issues, and estimated that the time line for
visa appointment rescheduling was unrealistic.
Not only that, they appeared to not know what they were doing when
I was at the visa center, and blocked my rescheduling due to
their government-grade service website.
This is when I started to think about giving up with the Spanish.

I checked the rules for Schengen visas and countries that
process visas quickly, and eventually chose France.
The visa went through smoothly and quickly.
The only downside was I needed to stay in France for the same number of
nights as I did in Spain. So, I was forced to tour Paris for 4 days,
a strange thing to say.

This is not exactly visa shopping because
my 4-night stay at Paris makes the visa application legitimate.
This is apparently a thing.
Later in the community session in IMC,
I heard Christophe talk about how one could get a visa appointment for
Norway or some other Nordic countries when the visa topic was brought up.

## Paris and how I got sick

The flight to Paris CDG went via Dallas DFW, and
the DFW-CDG flight was an uncomfortable 8 hours.
I got the worst seat, between the window and the aisle.
No posture was comfortable.
The food was also pathetic; both my neighbors left most of
their meals untouched.

What was worse?
American Airlines people had very little tolerance for
passengers hanging around.
To relieve the stress in these long-haul flights,
I usually do these small standing sessions for
around ten minutes at the back of the plane.
This plane, however, was configured to have no room at the back, so
I hung around the food lounge and the emergency gates in the middle.
Flight attendants would just go by and tell me to go back to my seat.
One of them even stopped by to say they cannot have people camping around.

This could have been a cultural thing.
There was a fat man in a suit sitting near one of the gates I hung around.
I was standing there leaning on the jump seat drinking juice, and
he stared at me.
After a while, he got up, so I moved around to leave him some room to go to
the lavatory. Instead, he stood on my face, and said "go somewhere else".
"This guy thinks he owns this place," I thought.
I stared at him, had some more juice, and walked to the gate on the other side.
Apparently, fat Americans simply get offended when you appear near them and
get face to face.

When I got to Paris in the morning, though, the chaos began.
Since the AirBnB reservation starts from the afternoon, I decided to
hang around a park between the airport and the place I stayed at.
It was a very rural area with wind blowing across.
I did not bother to put my puffed jacket on, and got a bit cold.
Maybe I should have taken it more seriously at the time.

The lunch at a random restaurant proved Paris' food to be much cheaper than
that in Los Angeles.
This continued to be true throughout my stay, even in more central areas.
What annoyed me was the lack of local food.
Near the place I stayed at, it was all Pakistani, Indian, and Turkish food.
Even near La Louvre, I walked in a huge block of all Asian food.
I was like "what the heck is going on with this city? Where is the local food?"

On the second day, I toured Musée du Louvre for 4hr.
Unfortunately, it turned out the museum sells tickets with time slots, which
is basically reservation.
Since I spent the time before the trip desperately preparing for my talk,
I only booked the tickets on the day I arrived and
got the late 13:30 entrance time. The museum closes at 18:00.

Having a late entrance to the museum did not bother to
make the whole tour ultra long.
I only woke up at around 10:00 due to jet lag, and
walked around the famous piss river after my breakfast.
Paris is really coherent with the styles of roads and buildings.
I kind of see why people like the city and find it romantic.
In the museum, I saw beautiful NSFW oil paintings and took selfies with
the tiny transgender Mona Lisa painting people line up to see.

On my way back though, I got into trouble.
I was taking the same metro line that I went to central Paris with.
It stopped at a station and never resumed.
Eventually, the driver said something in the announcement and
people looked upset, some of them getting off.
After a while, everyone got off and started waiting on the platform.
The driver got of the train and walked to the other end, and drove it back!

I assumed there was a problem with the train, and waited for
the next one like many other passengers did.
The next train came, and we got on.
And, the announcement from the driver started…
People were upset, and eventually got off. Some left the station.
After a while, the driver said something to the crowd, and some people got on,
so I followed them. The train drove back to the previous station!

Okay, so I realized there was some problem with the line and
what the driver offered us was to drive us back to the previous station which
had transfer options.
In the monitors that displayed information,
I finally saw the English translation of the announcement.
It said that the line was partially shut down due to an unattended bag, and
that the service would resume after some time.
I went to the platform to wait for the service to resume, but
got systematically kicked out by the people shutting down the line.
Some of them knew English and explained to me that I needed to change my route.

I had to take another metro line and transfer to a bus.
That bus station for the exact bus line I needed to take was also moved, for
some reasons, and it took me a while to figure it out.
With the rush and mishaps, I also took the wrong direction once and
missed a bus because of not waving for it to stop.
The supposedly 50min trip took 2hr, and by the time I got to
the AirBnB place it was already 22:30.
I apparently did not learn this lesson that public transport in
a language I completely have knowledge of is a guaranteed disaster, and
did it again later in my trip to the airport.

This was when I woke up and felt something stuck in
my throat the next afternoon.
I realized it was almost a cold and it became dangerous to my talk because
I lost my voice.
I had had trouble speaking for extended periods of time in the days leading to
the trip when I practiced my talk, but this one was finally the bomb detonated.
I could hear my mumbling talk being very deep when listening to
the recordings of my practice talks.

After a day of rest and not getting better, I decided it was time to
do something other than hoping for self-healing. I asked my AirBnB host.
She typed a line of text on my phone and told me to go to
a medicine store nearby and show they this text.
I went there, went in line, saw the guy behind a counter, showed him the text,
and told him I had a throat inflammation in English.
The guy replied in French, went to the back of the store, and came back with
some medicine.
So, I bought that random drug and took it according to my host's instructions.
I also aborted all my travel in Paris and stayed in bed until I left.

The CDG airport was super small, with no restaurants or shops in it.
The counter only checked my boarding pass and simply let me onto the plane,
not even checking my passport. This was how I got to Madrid.

## Madrid and the talk

Madrid was surprisingly super crowded.
The MAD airport has a fitting name, that the airport has many levels and
a long and slow line connecting many terminals far apart.
The metro was crowded, stations have direction signs only at the entrances but
not at the platforms, and the platforms are connected by mazes of passage ways.
The conference was near Gran Via, meaning "great road", and
it was a super crowded central area with mountains of people, mostly Caucasian,
walking around the streets by the various shops.
It was also much more expensive.

The hostel I stayed at was quite a place.
The staff were all young people who spoke English, and
they continuously organize events like free food and tours around the city.
I was not in the mood for any events because
the talk still had some major problems although
it was only two days before I would give it.
Italo wanted to show some `whois` queries about Spanish autonomous systems and
gave me some materials last-minute.
Belly lying on the twin bed in my 4-person shared room, I managed to
figure out where I could sneak in that part to my talk.

But, I could not practice my talk aloud.
I was lucky to meet Ethan at the reception the day before the conference.
He knew I was sick and reminded me the most important thing to do was to
get enough rest.
That was kind of hard to do, though, because
I completely did not overcome my jet lag.
I would go to bed at around 22:00, think about the talk in my head, and
become fully awake at around 01:00.
My roommates were also nuts, and they would come back at 02:00 after who
knows what.
The streets outside the hostel were also loud, and the earplugs I got from
the front desk was kind of weak.
Anyway, I managed to get up at around 08:00 every day and stayed awake for
the conference.

Maybe it could have been a good thing that I practiced my talk in my head.
The midnight before I gave the talk, I thought of something nice.
Italo always thought the introduction was a slow ramp and
wanted something more catchy, as did Ethan. I essentially came up with
a catchy clickbait intro at 01:00 after 3hr of thinking in bed.
I got up, checked the Sao Paulo time, and
realized I would not receive any feedback from
Italo about this new intro before I give talk if I waited until morning, so
I called him.
He picked it up, said he liked it, and told me I am crazy and should go to
sleep after finding out it was 01:00 for me.
The next day, I gave the talk, and visibly saw people to be looking when
I said the crazy intro.
I think this last-minute idea from thinking in bed was a huge enhancement to
my talk.

Anyway, the talk went most as planned.
People seemed to be listening instead of focusing on their phones and laptops,
and I said most of the things I planned to say. There were some minor details.
During my dry run at NSL, people suggested that
the projector may screw up the slides a bit and I needed more margins in
each direction.
At the conference, I saw that the projector was very good and
we could see the whole slide, but the speaker would stand in front of
the main screen and block the view.
The stupid thing about the setup was that the lectern would block part of
the main screen, and it blocks more after the speaker stood there and
put their laptop on the lectern.
I really wanted to avoid blocking more screen, although
I did place a large margin at the bottom of each slide, so
I essentially pressed down the laptop screen after plugging it in, which
I believe made the experience much better for the audience at the center.
However, I messed up with the clicker and
clicked a lock-screen button near the end of my talk, although
I fortunately immediately restored the setup thanks to
not having speaker notes and only needing to fullscreen my Google Slides.
Later, I talked to another speaker, he was like "after I saw you did that,
I was saying to myself 'DO NOT press that button' when I did the presentation".
I think I went over time, though, because
my session chair Phillippa looked unmoved and said we only had time for
one quick question, although she probably simply is that style and
the conference had always been overtime at that point.

Presentations are hard.
I saw so many people committing "presentation crimes": having walls of text,
reading the slides or speaker notes,
dumping information without giving the audience time to comprehend,
having a final slide with only "thank you" in it, and
standing still without eye contact. I am glad that I avoided those.

## The conference overall

Jet lag made it unnecessarily hard to enjoy the conference.
I could barely be excited, and I am surprised quite a few people decided to
talk to me anyway during the breaks and when eating weird Spanish snacks.
Most of these are PhD students.
The professors are super busy doing stuff, and many of them are "chairs" of
something. I later found out there were somewhere around 20 chairs…

There are a few interesting talks.
I forgot most of them, but I remember learning that
QUIC is not unfair against CUBIC, many Web-related research are social, and
crypto is encroaching into the IMC.
The community session was quite an experience, where
the chairs discussed the review process, how they separated long and
short paper reviews this year, and what they should do to
bring PhD students into the review process.
I never knew the existence of shadow PC, which sounded stupid.
They also touched on the visa issue.
I talked to
George Smaragdakis about letting people share their visa experiences;
he has not replied yet.
I also saw Dave Levin, who rejected my PhD application very late.
It was kind of fun to see these people.

At the end, I remembered to ask people for contact.
It is quite difficult when you do not want to use social media to stay in
touch.
I gave in and added some people on LinkedIn, while only exchanged emails with
others.
It is obviously difficult to stay in the loop with emails, but
I guess I will write people emails from time to time when I remember them.
I really need to prioritize that over all the other dues!
