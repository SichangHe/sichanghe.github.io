# IMC '24

I am on an A380 flying back to Los Angeles at 0.9 mach.
IMC '24 just concluded yesterday.
It was nice in that I heard several interesting talks, met enthusiastic people,
and ate random Spanish food at the conference.
I also gave a talk, which mostly went as planned.
It was unfortunate in that I got sick midway through the trip and
struggled with jet lag despite having stayed in UTC+1 for
4 days before the conference.

Let me recall the mishaps I experienced leading to the conference and
the journey in Europe.

## Funding issues

The \$2000 trip was originally not funded at all.

After my paper was accepted, I asked three departments of DKU for travel funds,
and got none. The main argument is I have graduated.
I offered a proposition to the executive vise chancellor, saying that
I would put DKU as my institution.
Apparently, they did not recognize the significance of having papers in
conferences this prestige, although I did not find any DKU papers in
conferences at this level.
With that, DKU officially have zero direct contribution in my paper, so
I decided not to list them as my institution.

This was at one point a huge time eater and upset moment.
It is especially upsetting because I got a personal offer to
partially fund my travel, in exchange for DKU being listed as my institution,
which would have looked very shameful.
However, this is understandable because I know DKU is experiencing a decline in
administrative efficiency.
Though, Italo also thought it looked bad, and listed DKU in his institution.

Eventually, I followed Harsha's advice to apply for a student travel grant from
IMC, and fortunately got it.
This twist, however, caused delays in my preparation for the conference, and
had time implications I would discover later.

## Visa shopping

IMC '24 was in Madrid, Spain, but I did not got a Spanish visa.
This would normally have meant I would not be able to enter Spain at all.
I was at the conference thanks to a workaround for Schengen visas.

I applied for the Spanish visa through their official agency,
got rejected because of minor issues, and estimated that the time line for
visa appointment rescheduling was unrealistic.
Not only that, they appeared to not now what they were doing when
I was at the visa center, and blocked my rescheduling due to
their government-grade service website.
This is when I started to think about giving up with the Spanish.

I checked the rules for Schengen visas and countries that
process visas quickly, and eventually chose France.
The visa went through smoothly and quickly.
The only downside was I needed to stay in France for the same number of
nights as I did in Spain. So, I was forced to tour Paris for 4 days,
a strange thing to say.

This is not exactly visa shopping because
my 4-night stay at Paris makes the visa application legitimate.
This is apparently a thing.
Later in the community session in IMC,
I heard Christophe talk about how one could get a visa appointment for
Norway or some other Nordic countries when the visa topic was brought up.

## Paris and how I got sick

The flight to Paris CDG went via Dallas DFW, and
the DFW-CDG flight was an uncomfortable 8 hours.
I got the worst seat, between the window and the aisle.
No posture was comfortable.
The food was also pathetic; both my neighbors left most of
their meals untouched.

What was worse?
American Airlines people had very little tolerance for
passengers hanging around.
To relieve the stress in these long-haul flights,
I usually do these small standing sessions for
around ten minutes at the back of the plane.
This plane, however, was configured to have no room at the back, so
I hung around the food lounge and the emergency gates in the middle.
Flight attendants would just go by and tell me to go back to my seat.
One of them even stopped by to say they cannot have people camping around.

This could have been a cultural thing.
There was a fat man in a suit sitting near one of the gates I hung around.
I was standing there leaning on the jump seat drinking juice, and
he stared at me.
After a while, he got up, so I left him some room to go to the lavatory.
Instead, he stood on my face, and said "go somewhere else".
"This guy thinks he owns this place," I thought.
I stared at him, had some more juice, and walked to the gate on the other side.
Apparently, fat Americans simply get offended when you appear near them and
get face to face.

When I got to Paris in the morning, though, the chaos began.
Since the AirBnB reservation starts from the afternoon, I decided to
hang around a park between the airport and the place I stayed at.
It was a very rural area with wind blowing across.
I did not bother to put my puffed jacket on, and got a bit cold.
Maybe I should have taken it more seriously at the time.

The lunch at a random restaurant proved Paris' food to be much cheaper than
that in Los Angeles.
This continued to be true throughout my stay, even in more central areas.
What annoyed me was the lack of local food.
Near the place I stayed at, it was all Pakistani, Indian, and Turkish food.
Even near La Louvre, I walked in a huge block of all Asian food.
I was like "what the heck is going on with this city? Where is the local food?"

On the second day, I toured Musée du Louvre for 4hr.
Unfortunately, it turned out the museum sells tickets with time slots, which
is basically reservation.
Since I spent the time before the trip desperately preparing for my talk,
I only booked the tickets on the day I arrived and
got the late 13:30 entrance time. The museum closes at 18:00.

Having a late entrance to the museum did not bother to
make the whole tour ultra long.
I only woke up at around 10:00 due to jet lag, and
walked around the piss river after my breakfast.
Paris is really coherent with the styles of roads and buildings.
I kind of see why people like the city and find it romantic.
In the museum, I saw beautiful NSFW oil paintings and took selfies with
the tiny painting people line up to see.

On my way back though, I got into trouble.
I was taking the same metro line that I went to central Paris with.
It stopped at a station and never resumed.
Eventually, the driver said something in the announcement and
people looked upset, some of them getting off.
After a while, everyone got off and started waiting on the platform.
The driver got of the train and walked to the other end, and drove it back!

I assumed there was a problem with the train, and waited for
the next one like many other passengers did.
The next train came, and we got on.
And, the announcement from the driver started…
People were upset, and eventually got off. Some left the station.
After a while, the driver said something to the crowd, and some people got on,
so I followed them. The train drove back to the previous station!

Okay, so I realized there was some problem with the line and
what the driver offered us was to drive us back to the previous station which
had transfer options.
In the monitors that displayed information,
I finally saw the English translation of the announcement.
It said that the line was partially shut down due to an unattended bag, and
that the service would resume after some time.
I went to the platform to wait for the service to resume, but
got systematically kicked out by the people shutting down the line.
Some of them knew English and explained to me that I need to change my route.

I had to take another metro line and transfer to a bus.
That bus station for the exact bus line I needed to take was also moved, for
some reasons, and it took me a while to figure it out.
With the rush and mishaps, I also took the wrong direction once and
missed a bus because of not waving for it to stop.
The supposedly 50min trip took 2hr, and by the time I got to
the place it was already 22:30.
I apparently did not learn this lesson that public transport in
a language I completely have knowledge of is a guaranteed disaster, and
did it again later in my trip to the airport.

This was when I woke up and felt something stuck in
my throat the next afternoon.
I realized it was almost a cold and it became dangerous to my talk because
I lost my voice.
I had had trouble speaking for extended periods of time in the days leading to
the trip when I practiced my talk, but this one was finally the bomb detonated.
I could hear my mumbling talk being very deep when listening to
the recording of my practice talks.

After a day of rest and not getting better, I decided it was time to
do something other than hoping for self-healing. I asked my AirBnB host.
She typed a line of text on my phone and told me to go to
a medicine store nearby and show they this text.
I went there, went in line, saw the guy behind a counter, showed him the text,
and told him I had a throat inflammation in English.
The guy replied in French, went to the back of the store, and came back with
some medicine.
So, I bought that medicine and took it according to my host's instructions,
basically trying random drugs.
I also aborted all my travel in Paris and stayed in bed until I left.

## The talk
