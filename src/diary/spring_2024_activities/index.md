## Flower "AI" Summit 2024, London

Professor Nicolas Lane invited Professor Bing Luo to give a talk at Flower
Summit 2024 about FedCampus.
Since Professor Luo thought it to be a nice opportunity for me (or rather,
he does not know how FedCampus works technically),
he brought me in to co-talk.

As a result, I begged DKU Undergraduate Studies
and Division of Natural and Applied Sciences (DNAS)
to sponsor my trip to London, and got
a whopping ￥3500 + ￥5000.

I stayed at London from 03-13 night to 03-16 morning,
brought [a poster about Fed Kit](fedkit_flower_summit2024poster_15.45.24.pdf),
and gave $\frac{1}{3}$ of a talk.
The talk was [live streamed on YouTube][flower_live_stream],
together with all other Flower Summit talks.
It was one of the only talks where the audience was laughing... But,
the live stream did not catch that sound track.

On my flight back, however,
I had some thermal cycles, and caught what I believed to be a bacterial
infection. After I got back, I heard someone else also got sick on a plane. Man,
flights are dangerous! Not because they crash, but because they are infectious.

Overall, I bought only 3 brunches at the inn,
and figured out all other meals with unhealthy free food from the summit.
On 03-16, my butt hurt, so I was standing and kneeing,
and got really tired in the afternoon, and started sleeping in the conference.
I immediately went to sleep once back to the inn, at around 18.

And then, I suffered from a -2hr jet lag when I got back to DKU.

People asked me whether it was fun. I told them the conference was "fine".
> The academics wanted to present their papers - so, yeah...

I did talk to a few Ph.D. students and some Flower Labs people.
I remember people being unsatisfied when I told them to find me on GitHub, and asked for my LinkedIn.
I guess I have to use this atrocious ad platform now.
There was a recently-graduated dude from New Zealand -
who added machine learning to his statistics research because everyone was doing
machine learning -
and a few people who basically told me that they "borrowed" our implementation
to do on-smartphone federated learning.

I mean, FedKit is open source, and so is the code we contributed to Flower,
but getting 0 credit is less fun than anticipated.
I now understand why people put those corporate-style authorship and copyright
notice in every single one of their source files.
