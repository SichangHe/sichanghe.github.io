# ~300x Speed Up in Rust: Finding Inexact Matches in Nested Sets

I optimized my route analyzer to 300 times faster.
It analyzed around 800 million routes within 3 hours[^cpu].
The exact multiply of speedup does not matter; rather,
I find it valuable to discuss the data structure changes, profiling,
and algorithm experiments, the major gains, and the wasted effort.

No, I did not rewrite a Python implementation to gain a trivial 50x speedup;
I started with a multithreaded Rust implementation.
In this case,
Rust seems to have been a wise choiceâ€”much more straightforward to optimize for
speed than those garbage-collected languages with extra pointer chasing.

The main bottleneck of the route analyzer lay in finding inexact matches of
IP address prefixes in nested sets.
In our research,
this matching is a core functionality because we used the analyzer to
match routes on the Internet against public routing policies.
The technicality of the research does not matter here,
but we need some basic context to understand the optimizations.

## Simplified background

As the pseudocode below illustrates,
our task is to implement the `match_nested_set` method on
the `Matcher` data structure[^real-code].
This method should output whether the Matcher's (IP address)
prefix (`self.prefix`) matches a nested set of prefixes based on its `name`.
Additionally,
it should accept a Range Operator `op` that
can modify how the prefix matching is done.

```rust
struct Matcher {
    prefix: IpNet,
    sets: BTreeMap<usize, Vec<IpNet>>,
    nested_sets: BTreeMap<String, NestedSet>,
}

impl Matcher {
    fn match_nested_set(self, name: String, op: RangeOperator) -> bool {
        unimplemented!()
    }
}
```

The example pseudo code below checks if
the prefix `193.254.30.0/24` matches the nested set `CUSTOMERS` with
the Range Operator `Plus`.
The nested set `CUSTOMERS` has a member `69` that
contains the prefix `193.254.0.0/16`.
Since `193.254.0.0/16` contains `193.254.30.0/24` and
`Plus` specifies the "contains" relationship,
then the method should return `true`.

```rust
let matcher = Matcher {
    prefix: 193.254.30.0/24,
    sets: BTreeMap(69: 193.254.0.0/16),
    nested_sets: BTreeMap(
        "CUSTOMERS": NestedSet { sets: [69], nested_sets: [] }
    ),
};
matcher.match_nested_set("CUSTOMERS", RangeOperator::Plus)
// => true
```

To understand the problem, I started with a straightforward implementation.

## Naive implementation

```rust
impl Matcher {
    fn match_nested_set(
        self,
        name: String,
        op: RangeOperator,
        visited: Vec<String>,
    ) -> bool {
        let Some(nested_set) = self.nested_sets.get(name) else {
            return false;
        };
        for set in nested_set.sets {
            if self.match_set(set, op, visited) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        for nested_set in nested_set.nested_sets {
            if self.match_nested_set(nested_set, op, visited) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        false
    }

    fn match_set(
        self,
        name: String,
        op: RangeOperator,
        visited: Vec<String>,
    ) -> bool {
        if visited.contains(name) {
            return false;
        }
        visited.push(name);
        let Some(set) = self.sets.get(name) else {
            return false;
        };
        set.iter()
            .any(|prefix| prefix_and_op_matches(prefix, op, self.prefix))
    }
}
```

The pseudocode above is mostly trivial for the average programmers,
except for a few places.

1. Using Rust's `let else` syntax, we look up `name` in the sets,
    and either bind the result to the variable,
    or return `false` early if `name` is not found.
1. `visited` tracks the set names we have checked to
    prevent infinite recursions from nested sets that contain each other.
1. The `set.iter().any` expression uses a common declarative pattern.
    It loops through the `prefix` elements in `set`,
    calls `prefix_and_op_matches` on each of them,
    and returns true iff one of the calls returns true.
1. `prefix_and_op_matches` is a helper function that checks if
    a prefix matches the Range Operator and another prefix.

## Standard data structure changes

Profiling and standard data structure changes were the lowest-handing fruit.
Although I lost the exact performance record of early implementations,
my benchmark code checked only 256 routes and clearly took minutes to run.
I understood that the naive implementation would not scale,
so I immediately started profiling the benchmark code to find where most of
the time was spent.

Surprisingly, [Cargo-FlameGraph]
showed that most of the time was spent on checking if
set names have been visited (`visited.contains`).
`visited` was a vector,
and its linear search compounded with recursion to a cubic growth.
I chose to use vectors because I thought most nested sets would have less than
ten members, in which case linear search would be fine,
but my assumption was clearly wrong.
I changed `visited` to use `HashSet` and boosted the speed by perhaps 10 times.

The other effective change was to replace the maps.
`Matcher` contains two B-tree maps,
which are amazing sorted binary trees with $O(\log n)$ lookup time complexity.
However, hash maps have $\Theta(1)$ lookup.
Therefore, it was a no-brainer to try replacing `BTreeMap` with `HashMap`.
I recall this find-replace change causing the `get` calls to
occupy seemingly larger areas in the flame graph!
However, I also saw a 30% faster benchmark, so the hash map was faster.

The hash map being only slightly faster than the B-tree map was no surprise.
The B-tree map is cache-efficient,
and avoids the somewhat expensive string hashing.
This means, for smaller maps, the B-tree may be faster.
Though,
it turned out that my maps are large enough and
my string keys are small enough, such that the hash map won.

These trivial changes turned out to be clear wins,
and show some basics of performance optimization:

- Code profiling helps check our assumptions of run-time complexities.
- Data structure choices can greatly affect performance,
    and both complexity analysis and benchmarking help pick them.

## Custom data structure

<!-- TODO: Bloom hash table. -->

## Repetition reduction

Recall the current implementation:

```rust
impl Matcher {
    fn match_nested_set(
        self,
        name: String,
        op: RangeOperator,
        visited: HashSet<String>,
    ) -> bool {
        let Some(nested_set) = self.nested_sets.get(name) else {
            return false;
        };
        for set in nested_set.sets {
            if self.match_set(set, op, visited) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        for nested_set in nested_set.nested_sets {
            if self.match_nested_set(nested_set, op, visited) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        false
    }

    fn match_set(
        self,
        name: String,
        op: RangeOperator,
        visited: HashSet<String>,
    ) -> bool {
        if visited.contains(name) {
            return false;
        }
        visited.add(name);
        let Some(set) = self.sets.get(name) else {
            return false;
        };
        set.iter()
            .any(|prefix| prefix_and_op_matches(prefix, op, self.prefix))
    }
}
```

Of course,
it is easy to see how repeating recursion calls in nested loops can be slow,
but it is quite tricky to flatten these loops.
I started with an inside-out approach,
first targeting the linear search at the end of `match_set`.

I created a custom binary search to match a prefix against a set of
prefixes with a range operator `op`.
A regular binary search does not suffice because
this prefix matching is not exact unless `op` is a No-op,
therefore it made sense to check them one by one.
However, range operators do not permit arbitrary matches;
they at most relax the matching to specific ranges.
Together with the fact that, once sorted,
similar prefixes become close to each other,
we have a much more efficient algorithm based on binary search.

As shown below,
we first obtain a starting point `center` from regular binary search,
check for the exact match case (`op` is No-op),
then search right and left in
the prefix list until they are no longer siblings with `prefix`.

```rust
fn match_prefixs(prefix: IpNet, prefixs: [IpNet], op: RangeOperator) -> bool {
    let center = prefixs.binary_search(prefix);

    // Exact match.
    if let RangeOperator::NoOp = op {
        return center.is_ok();
    }

    let center = center.map_or_else(identity, identity);
    // Check center.
    if let Some(value) = prefixs.get(center) {
        if prefix_and_op_matches(value, op, prefix) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    // Check right.
    for value in &prefixs[(center + 1).min(prefixs.len())..] {
        if prefix_and_op_matches(value, op, prefix) {
            return true;
        }
        if !prefix.is_sibling(value) {
            break;
        }
    }
    // Check left.
    for value in prefixs[..(center.saturating_sub(1)).max(prefixs.len())]
        .iter()
        .rev()
    {
        if prefix_and_op_matches(value, op, prefix) {
            return true;
        }
        if !prefix.is_sibling(value) {
            break;
        }
    }
    false
}
```

<!-- TODO: Finish this off. -->

<!--
- Prefix matching is inexact.
    Depending on $o$, $(p_i,o)$ may be a match of $p$ if $p_i$ equals $p$,
    contains $p$, or contains but not equals $p$, or,
    $p$ itself must satisfy some condition.
    So, simple lookups like hash table lookup and binary search do not suffice.
- AS Sets can be nested.
    $\mathcal A_i=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,\mathcal A_{i1},\mathcal A_{i2},\ldots\}$
    may contain both ASes $a_j$ and other AS Sets $\mathcal A_{ij}$.
    So,
    finding a match for $p$ in
    $\mathcal A_i$ may require checking an *unbounded* number of sets.
-->

## Tenable caching

<!-- - There are too many prefix ranges.
    Flattening the set of all prefixes for
    each AS Set would eliminate the nesting,
    but I tried that and ran out of all 300GiB of RAM,
    causing the server to hang for a while
    (fortunately my admin did not notice it).
