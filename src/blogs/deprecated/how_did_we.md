# How did we get here? WordPress?

This was when I set up the blog in WordPress.

## WTF

Isn't WordPress for non-technical people? Why would I use WordPress?

Also, why am I starting a blog? Didn't I say that I don't need a blog?

## The reality

Well, if I wrote something moderately decent and long,
I need a more decent place for it other than GitHub issues and Reddit.

Of course, I could use GitHub Pages to make a static site,
but people wouldn't be able to comment on that.

Of course,
I could set up a whole server with a JavaScript front-end library
(probably Svelte) and a back-end with Rust, deploy it on Amazon lambda,
and connect it to a PostgreSQL database. That would be really cool.
But, then, I would probably need to find a domain for it and pay $20 a yearâ€¦
I don't want to.

Also, people don't care about you knowing how to mess with AWS,
they only appreciate the silly CSS tricks they see that makes up the front-end.
So,
setting up a server manually and hosting a blog probably would not be worth it.

## What I get with WordPress

- A subdomain.
- Free content server.
- No setup, I just write and post.

## Conclusion

For now, that is it. I'll post random articles here.
But,
I will manually keep
[a Markdown copy on GitHub](https://github.com/SichangHe/blog_backup).
